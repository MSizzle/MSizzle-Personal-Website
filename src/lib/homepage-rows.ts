/**
 * Row derivation for the Building and Writing homepage bands, moved out of
 * `section-building.tsx` / `section-writing.tsx` verbatim (21.5-02) so the
 * accent-rotation offset math (`homepageAccentOffsets` below) reads the
 * exact same row counts the two sections actually render. Behaviour is
 * unchanged from what those components did inline before this plan.
 *
 * `homepageAccentOffsets` deliberately does NOT use `projects.length` /
 * `posts.length` as a shortcut -- that would be wrong twice over: Building
 * always prepends a hardcoded Prometheus row (so `projects.length`
 * under-counts by one), and both bands cap their row count before rendering
 * (so `projects.length`/`posts.length` over-counts once either array exceeds
 * its cap). Deriving the offsets from `buildingRows` / `writingRows` instead
 * means the counter can never drift from what is actually on the page.
