 * SectionWriting: terminal-format Writing log (HP-03). Renders real blog
 * posts only -- newest-first, capped at 5 rows -- as a mono `~/writing` log
 * with no box around it, only the header carrying a visible rule. Reuses
 * the .e-term/.e-post CSS family (identical full-row hover/focus-invert
 * mechanism as .a-row in Plan 21-02). Server Component only; no client
 * directive.
 *
 * Row derivation lives in `@/lib/homepage-rows` (21.5-02) so the accent
 * rotation offset math and the rendered rows can never drift apart.
 *
 * Quick task 260722-wov (item 2) intentionally removed the prior
 * posts+Monty-Monthly merge: this homepage log is posts-only now. Monty
 * Monthly issues still appear on /writing, in their own dedicated section
 * (enlarged as part of the same quick task).
